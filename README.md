# Carbon Isotope Simulation

## _Academic Year of 2016-2017_

This project is about a simple simulation of the carbon isotope atom (C), carbon-12, carbon-13 and carbon-14 (<sup>12</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C). This simplified version is implemented with some creation/deletion functions with the support of classes, concentrating on the range between the members of the classes.
